# Basic-Statistics
Statistics for life data analyses

This repository has the objective of being the first steps for those who want to start knowing how they work and what are the most common linear models used in biostatistics. The learning flows as a data set were provided by the Department of Marine Sciences and Applied Biology of the University of Alicante.

Through exercises during this workshop, you will learn to test the significance of the effects of certain factors on quantitative and categorical variables, as well as how to make predictive models. Two chapters are also included to reduce the number of variables to study, such as cluster analysis as PCA. All this programming in R-project, using the most famous packages for data treatment and ordering (i.e., tidyverse...), as well as its visualization (i.e., ggplot2...).

What are you waiting for to discover how to take advantage of your datasets, in addition to presenting your results in a striking and easy way to communicate!
