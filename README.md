# Statistics for life data analyses

This repository has the objective of being the first steps for those who want to start becoming knowledable in biostatistics, passing throught the most common descriptive analyses to statisticlaly test factors significance and influence between variables, as well as simulate possible responses in different scenarios. The learning flow and datasets were provided by the Department of Marine Sciences and Applied Biology of the University of Alicante.

Once you have completed all the chapters, you will have learnt to test the significance of the effects of certain factors on quantitative and categorical variables, as well as how to make predictive models (ANOVA, PERMANOVA, correlation test and simple/multiple regression). Two chapters are also included to reduce the number of variables to study, such as CLUSTER analysis and Principal Component Analysis. All this programming in R-project with Markdown sintax, and using the most famous packages for data wrangling, treatment and ordering (i.e., tidyverse), as well as visualization (i.e., ggplot2).

> What are you waiting for to discover how to take advantage of your datasets, in addition to presenting your results in a striking and easy way to communicate!
