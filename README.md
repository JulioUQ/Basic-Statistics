# Statistics for life data analyses

This repository has the objective of being the first steps for those who want to start becoming knowledable in biostatistics, passing throught the most common statistical analyses to test factors significance and influence of co-variates, as well as simulate possible responses of varibles in different scenarios. The learning flows as a data set were provided by the Department of Marine Sciences and Applied Biology of the University of Alicante.

In this workshop, you will learn to test the significance of the effects of certain factors on quantitative and categorical variables, as well as how to make predictive models (ANOVA, PERMANOVA and simple/multiple regression). Two chapters are also included to reduce the number of variables to study, such as CLUSTER analysis and Principal Component Analysis. All this programming in R-project and presented in Markdown, using the most famous packages for data treatment and ordering (i.e., tidyverse), as well as visualization (i.e., ggplot2).

What are you waiting for to discover how to take advantage of your datasets, in addition to presenting your results in a striking and easy way to communicate!
