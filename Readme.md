### 1. **ANOVA**
#### 1.1. **What is it and what is it for?**

An ANOVA test is a way to find out if survey or experiment results are significant between groups. If we only have two groups to compare, then we will speak of a comparison analysis between two samples, while if there are three or more groups, then we will speak of analysis of variance (**"One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)**). This is called *"analysis of variance"*, since the differences between sources of variation (withing and among groups levels) are compared, and "one-way" because only one factor (treatment or grouping) is modified in the experiment.

Thus, ANOVA test starts with a ***"n"*** number of sampling and ***"k"*** number of categories, in order to answer if:

- There are significant differences between categories (**alternative hypothesis (Hi)**)
- There are not significant differences between categories (**null hypothesis (Ho)**)

#### 1.2. **Scuba-diving samplings.**

**For example**, we want to study the abundance in three distances from a marine protected area (MPA), one of which has a certain level of protection (fisheries). It is expected that by comparing the values of this zone with that of two others with similar characteristics, the fact will be evident. 

Random scuba-diving samplings have been carried out in a marine reserve (*Tabarca island, Alicante*). A set of different variables were visually measured: A) Species diversity, B) Total abundance and biomass, and C) Abundance and biomass per 4 species. The samplings have been carried out at three distances (near, medium and far) from the reserve, in 3 seasons of the year (summer, winter and autumn), repeating the sampling 7 days in each season, with 6 samplings each day. The objective of this example will be to check if there are significant differences for the abundance mean sampled as a function of the distance to the reserve.

- Are the differences observed between the groups **due to a real effect?** 
- Are the observed differences between the groups **due to random variation?**
- What would we find if we repeat the experiment?
- If there are differences, how significant are they?
